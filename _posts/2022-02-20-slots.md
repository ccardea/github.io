## UsingSlots
While researching `__slots__` I found a page on the Python Wiki with the title "UsingSlots" that did not yet have any content. Since I was already looking into it, I thought I might as well write it up and contribute to the Wiki. This is my first contribution to the Python community.

The article is available on the Wiki at [UsingSlots](https://wiki.python.org/moin/UsingSlots)
