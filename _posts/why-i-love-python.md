## Why I Love Python

I'm getting back into computer programming after at least ten years of doing no programming at all. Learning Python seemed like a good place to start, since it seems to be popular and good learning resources are available. It is apparently widely used in Data Science, which is a field that interests me. From the perspective of someone who has been around computers for a long time, I think Python is great! In a nutshell:
- It's as easy to use a Basic
- It's nearly as powerful as languages like C and C++
- The available tools are excellent

### Ease Of Use
Python is simple an intutive. This goes hand in hand with the excellent tools. I obtained Python through Anaconda. Their distribution includes an interactive Python, which makes writing Python code just like the Basic that I used in the past. This has proved to be a highly effective tool for learning and experimenting with new ideas.

### Powerful
In addition to a very nice set of built-in features, Python includes a large library of modules that can be used in any Python program. This makes it possible to do just about anything with Python. At my level of programming, I have yet to find a scenario that Python can't handle.

### Excellent Tools
I've been using Spyder from Anaconda and Visual Studio Code for my development environments. Both are excellent. The single most helpful feature of these tools is their ability to catch most syntax errors before you even try to run the code. This eliminates many tedious hours of trying to debug small errors and allows programmers to become much more productive. Visual Studio Code also integrates nicely with Git. To me, this is programming heaven!
