### Dark Cloud -> Silver Lining
After the project was complete, I somehow managed to lose about a week's worth of data. That won't happen again. I now have a cron job that checks the database once per hour and runs a backup script if the file has changed. This was complicated by the fact that WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) doesn't automatically start cron like a full Linux system would. After a few missetps, running cron at system startup only took two lines of code in the right places. The entire process was a steep hill to climb, but I learned some valuable lessons about WSL, Linux and shell scripting.
