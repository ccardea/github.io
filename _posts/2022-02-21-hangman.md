## Hangman Demo Available##

The Hangman demonstration project is now available as a Jupyter Notebook on Google Colab. This is a cool little project that puts a new twist on the classic word game.
- Keeps statistics,
- Has an Assistant to help the player,
- The Assistant can play the game without a human player.

The notebook includes screenshots from the game, along with statistics and charts that show how the Assistant performs in both Interactive Assisted and Machine Only modes. I think you will find this interesting and enjoyable.
