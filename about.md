## C. Cardea
Looking to get started in data analytics

### A Little Bit About Me
My name is **Christopher Cardea**. I'm a former CPA with some programming experience and interests in relational database management systems and statistics. I believe I can be an asset in a Data Analytics/Engineering environment. I am currently working on a portfolio of projects to demonstrate my skills. 

### Computer Science Background and Experience
I took programming courses in college but am mostly self-taught. I've worked with C and C++ and more recently with PHP, along with HTML, CSS, and XML. I've studied object-oriented programming and design and relational database design. In the past I've created and used Microsoft Access and MySQL databases. I've run a Windows 2000 server and Apache web server, and made a few contributions to open-source projects on Drupal.

### Current Sills 
- Recently completed MIT courses for Python programming and Data Science (online)
- Currently auditing IBM Data Engineering Fundamentals
- Languages: Python, SQL
- Libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Jupyter Lab
- DBMS: SQLite, PostgreSQL

### Development Environment:
- Ubuntu/Linux
- Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) on Windows 11
- Visual Studio Code
- Git/Github
- Virtual environments using venv
- Package management: pip
