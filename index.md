# C. Cardea
- Returning user after being away for around 15 years.
- I came back to Github because I wanted to use a project that is hosted here.

## A Little Bit About Me
My name is **Christopher Cardea**. I'm recently retired and I got the crazy idea to build a computer, since I now have so much free time and want to keep my mind active. But I not only want to build it, I want to test whether the software I use can take advantage of the upgraded hardware capabilities. I found a performance counter project (opcm/pcm) on Github that I am considering using. I originally was hoping to find a pre-compiled version that I could use. That is available, but I would still have to compile a driver or get one from someone else. After giving it some thought, I decided to go ahead and get a copy of Visual Studio and try to compile the driver. That is going to be a challenge. Updates on my progress will be forthcoming.

## Background and Experience
I started out with computers in the military, using a punched card system. I took a couple of programming courses in college, but I'm mostly self taught. I've played around quite a bit and contributed to some open source projects on Drupal, but never did anything professionally in the programing field. The languageses I've worked with include:
- Basic
- COBOL
- Assembly
- C
- C++
- C#
- PHP
- HTML, CSS, XML
- SQL

My more recent work was on a Linux/Ubuntu system using Apache web server. I've never attempted Windows programming.

## Current Goals
I'm currently considering several things, but not yet fully committed, including
* Building, tuning and testing a PC.
* Compiling a Windows 10/11 driver for PCM, and possibly the rest of the project too.
* Structured learning through OSSU.
