## ALittle Bit About Me
I am recently retired and I got the crazy idea to build a computer. But no, that's not enough for me. I not only want to build it, I want to test whether the software I use can actually take advantage of the upgraded hardware capabilities. I found a performance counter project (OPCM) on Github that I want to use. I originally was hoping to find a precompiled version that i could use and that is available, but I would still have to compile a driver or do a cumbersome workaround. After giving it some thought, I decided to go ahead and get a copy of Visual Studio and try to compile it. That is where I'm at today. Updates on my progress will be forthcoming.
